<h3> What time feels like during a pandemic</h3>

<div class="container">
  <p>Time started to slow down weeks before it became apparent that we would be heading into a pandemic and because I did not have a television in front of me to keep up with the news I relied on my parents to inform me of the seriousness of the matter. Time in New York felt the same, fast paced, crowded streets and early sunset. News of the pandemic did not bring immediate panic or fear, I felt calm just as everyone else around me seemed. My parents called everyday to check up on me asking the daily questions </p>
  
<p> 
  “were you careful?” 
<br>
  “is everyone wearing masks yet?” 
<br>
  “make sure you keep away from         people!” 
</p>
   
<p>I almost found it bothersome listening to the same news and warnings everyday, it seemed like a virus that would cause unnecessary panic but soon brush away. 

I was anticipating spring break in Miami however the closer it got the further it seemed and this is when I started to grasp that time was slowing down and there was a significant focus on wondering what was going to become of the world in the following days. The week leading up to spring break everyday it seemed as if I was waking up to bad news which made me feel anxious. Time slowed down by the day, the bad news of the morning dragged into the evening for even more bad news of the day to strike by bedtime.</p>

<p>
   “Staicy stay away from any sick      people….” 
<br>
  “Staicy wash your hands and            disinfect”
<br>
  … don't touch...”
</p>
  
  <h4> “I think it's time for you to come home.” </h4>

Coming back home to Kenya every summer was always exciting, I looked forward to seeing all my friends, eating at my favourite restaurants and the wonderful nightlife of the city. But it was different this time… I was confined to the house… to my room for 14 days. The days at the beginning seemed to pace on but as I started to settle back in the time became slower, classes started and the days felt like forever considering all my classes started from 11 pm and ended 5am in the morning. I am now allowed to leave the apartment, so my routine is waking up in the afternoon, eating a late lunch, watching an episode of money heist while doing work and then wanting to start classes.  Everyday feels like the same day, I have to start getting creative with new inside hobbies. </p>
